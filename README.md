---

## 📌 Overview

This project is a C/C++-based application designed to assist in the planning, optimization, and resource management of mining operations. It models real-world mining scenarios, simulates task execution, and provides intelligent recommendations for efficient resource allocation.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- Optimal assignment of machinery and human resources to specific tasks.
- Time and sequence management to maximize productivity and minimize idle time.
- Scenario evaluation for strategic decision-making (e.g. maintenance timing, equipment redistribution).
- Basic simulation of schedules and workload balancing.
- Generation of performance indicators and operational reports.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

- **C/C++ structures** for modeling equipment, tasks, schedules, and resources.
- **Simple optimization algorithms** (e.g. greedy, search-based heuristics).
- **Console-based interface** (CLI) with plans to evolve to a more intuitive GUI wrapper for the `.exe`.
- **File handling** for storing data and simulation results.

## 🔍 Use Cases

- Mining operation planning and optimization.
- Educational purposes in civil and mining engineering.
- Research on project planning algorithms.
- Simulating and comparing resource allocation strategies.

---

## 🧠 Technologies & Concepts

- C/C++.
- Resource allocation logic and task scheduling.
- Simulation and scenario modeling.
- Clean output formatting for engineering-style reporting.
